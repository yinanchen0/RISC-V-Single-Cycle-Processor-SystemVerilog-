# RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Processor-SystemVerilog-
This repository contains the design, implementation, and verification of a single-cycle RISC-V processor, written in SystemVerilog. The project covers instruction decoding, datapath control, arithmetic logic operations, memory access, and full system integration with simulation-based verification.
